# Business Challenge
# Exploratory Data Analysis, mySQL Databases and SQL Queries

## Introduction

This business challenge takes a car dataset of recorded sales in the USA from december of 2014 to july 2015. Vehicules's production year range from 1990 to 2015.
The goal is to pick a business case, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for a mySQL Database using python, Create a new SQL db, inject the data and perform SQL queries to answer 10 questions related to our business case.

## Business case and context

Our brand new company is looking to enter the car selling market and knows nothing about it.

Scope of analysis : General.
Goal : Gain insight on broad data to determine what sub niche of the car market our company should focus on.

We want to know : How big is the market, who is the biggest player, nº of cars sold per month, most sold category, automatic vs manual…


## EDA

This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to the sale transactions of various vehicles (data from december of 2014 to july 2015), new and used, production year ranging from 1990 to 2015.

  ### Data cleaning

- Deleted the column MMR as it is not relevant for our analysis.
- Deleted the trim column as it is not relevant since we are conducting a general analysis on the cars market.
- Cleaned the sale date column to obtain only the day, month and year in SQL preferred format.
- Eliminated every row where at least one column has a null value, that way we are working with a dataset without null values :).

  ## mySQL preparation

I divided the dataset into 3 csv files to have 3 tables in SQL.
Those 3 tables are linked by a key like so :

The schema and tables creation was done through SQL code/queries.
Changed the permissions inside the my.ini file of the SQL server to allow data import from a local csv file with queries.

At last i queried the import from the csv files, filled my tables and verified if the import was done correctly.
